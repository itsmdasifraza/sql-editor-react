## SQL Editor React
Create, design and implement a web-based application capable of running SQL queries and displaying the results of said query. The application must include a space which accepts SQL queries in the form of user inputs, then runs the given query, and displays the result within the application..

### Features
1. **Lazy Loading for Table Data**: The list of available tables is fetched during the initial load. However, the actual data for each table is not fetched until the user clicks on the respective table's name. This on-demand loading strategy minimizes the initial load time and enhances the user experience by only fetching and displaying data when it's required.
2. **Data Export**: This application offers the capability to export query results in JSON format. Additionally, users have the convenience of saving queries, eliminating the need to retype frequently used commands.
3. **Customized SQL Queries**: One of the core features of this application is the ability for users to input and execute their own customized SQL queries. This empowers users to interact with the database using their preferred queries, making the application flexible and accommodating to various data analysis needs.
4. **Paginated Table Data**: To enhance the readability and navigation of large datasets, this application implements paginated table data presentation. Rather than overwhelming users with a lengthy list of entries, the application divides the data into manageable pages.
5. **Saved Queries and Tables**: Simplify your querying process with the convenience of saving and reusing pre-defined queries and tables within the application. This feature enhances efficiency and reduces the need for repetitive typing.
6. **Search History**: Enhancing user convenience, our application now includes a search query history feature. This functionality keeps track of previous search queries, allowing users to quickly revisit and reuse their past queries without the need to retype them.
7. **UI / UX**: A significant focus has been placed on refining the user interface and overall user experience. With enhanced visual design, intuitive navigation, and smoother interactions, our application now offers a more polished and user-friendly environment that maximizes user engagement and satisfaction.

### Optimizations
1. **Dynamic Request**: An exceedingly effective optimization technique revolves around dynamic fetching. This strategy involves retrieving table rows solely upon user request, thereby circumventing unnecessary data load during the initial phase.
2. **Memoization**: Sidebar and Table component, especially when dealing with complex calculations, has been thoughtfully optimized. By utilizing memoization, we've intelligently cached the results of high-computation functions. This ensures that the computations are performed only when inputs change, saving valuable processing time and contributing to a faster user interface.
3. **SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics)**: SVGs are utilized extensively for graphical elements within our application. These vector-based graphics remain crisp and clear regardless of screen resolution, and their compact file size promotes faster loading times. This optimization is particularly beneficial for icons, logos, and other graphical elements, contributing to a seamless user experience.
4. **Reduced Count of Rerenders**: In pursuit of superior performance, we've meticulously minimized the frequency of component rerenders that shares static values within our React application.

##  React Framework
1. **Efficiency**: React's component-based architecture allows for a more organized and modular approach to building user interfaces, even for smaller projects. This promotes code reusability and easier maintenance.
2. **Quick Setup**: React's lightweight nature and efficient tooling make it straightforward to set up and start coding quickly, which is advantageous for smaller projects with tight timelines.
3. **Reusable Components**: React's component reusability is valuable regardless of project size. It allows you to build self-contained, reusable UI elements that can be easily integrated into different parts of your application.
4. **Performance**: React's virtual DOM efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the UI, which can enhance performance, even in smaller projects. This becomes valuable as your project grows.

## Packages
1. [**Material UI**](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui): Material-UI is a popular and comprehensive UI library for React that embraces Google's Material Design principles. With a vast collection of customizable components, pre-designed layouts, and themes.
2. [**Code Mirror**](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror): CodeMirror is a versatile and highly customizable code editor component for the web. It offers developers a rich set of features including syntax highlighting, code completion, line numbering, and more.
